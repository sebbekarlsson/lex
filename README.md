# lex
> Simple lexer written in `C`.

## Compiling
> Simply run:

    make

## Running
> Make sure you have done everything in the `Compiling` step, then you can
> run the lexer doing something like:

    ./lex.out fiddle/someprogram.language

> to try it out.

## Unit test
> Coming soon!

## Notes
> This might become a new cool programming language later, so I would suggest
> to not depend on this project somehow. Feel free to copy the source code
> though.
